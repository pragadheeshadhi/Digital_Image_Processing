This repository contains a comprehensive collection of digital image processing programs designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts and techniques. 
It includes programs to analyze image quality by varying sampling and quantization levels, implement 2D transforms (DFT, DCT, Wavelet), explore DFT properties, and apply various point processing techniques. 
Filtering techniques in spatial and frequency domains, such as Low Pass, High Pass, Butterworth, Gaussian, and High Boost filters, are demonstrated alongside restoration methods like Inverse and Wiener filtering. 
The repository also covers advanced topics like line and edge detection, global/local/adaptive thresholding, feature extraction (boundary, regional, texture), and distance measures for k-Nearest Neighbor classification. 
These programs are ideal for students and enthusiasts to explore and understand key digital image processing concepts using standard tools.
